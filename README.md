# Game of Life, by Conway
Explore John Horton Conway's cellular automaton on a 20 x 10 grid, built using React.

## How to run
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Build the project using `npm run build`.
3. Navigate to the `./build` folder and run `index.html`.

## User interaction
When the application starts you will be met by a randomly-generated cell arrangement already iterating through its generations. You can use the corresponding buttons below the cell grid to pause and restart this animation, or alternatively clear the grid and implement your own starting pattern before playing the simulation again.

## Notes
